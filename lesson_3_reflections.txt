When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When we have a working version and ready to be used.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because not all the time we want to get the latest changes. We want to have the flexibility on when we want to get the latest changes. So we can have more control on what is inserted to our git. Also Git can't identify directly if there is a conflict when pulling the changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks will allow you to clone someone else repository from his/her GitHub to your GitHub.
    Clones will allow you to make a copy of a repository or your own branch.
    Branch is used when you want to have different version of your project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

   So that we know what is the last update that we pull from the remote. And if there are any updates since then on the remote.
